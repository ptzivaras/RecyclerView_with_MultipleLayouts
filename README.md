# RecyclerView_with_MultipleLayouts
This can show in each item in list a different design of each time. Usefull if you have many json data and cant show all with the same design.

-A dummy model object class, Item.java

-RecyclerView row item layout two, list_item_type2.xml
 RecyclerView row item layout one, list_item_type1.xml

-The RecyclerView Item adapter, this is where the magic happens for having multiple different layouts in the RecyclerView list item.
 Pay attention to getItemViewType and onCreateViewHolder.
